# GHNG
The Growing Hierarchical Neural Gas Self-Organizing Neural Network (GHNG) is a hierarchical extension of the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) where a tree of modified GNGs is learned from the input dataset, so that hierarchical data can be analyzed without the restriction of fixed lattice topologies among the neurons. This work was published in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS journal as "The Growing Hierarchical Neural Gas Self-Organizing Neural Network (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7484280)".
